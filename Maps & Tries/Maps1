/*Map data structure (also known as a dictionary , associative array , or hash map ) is defined as a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value.
Maps provide an efficient way to store and retrieve data based on a unique identifier (the key). */

/* A hashmap is a data structure that pairs keys to values.
It uses a hash function to calculate an index into an array of buckets, from which the desired value can be found.
Simply put, it's like a real-world dictionary where you know the 'word' (key), and you quickly find its meaning' (value). */

Ordered Map:
An ordered map maintains the order in which key-value pairs are inserted. This means that iterating over the map will return the pairs in the order they were added.

Unordered Map:
An unordered map does not maintain the order of key-value pairs. The order in which elements are returned during iteration is not guaranteed and may vary across different implementations or executions.

Feature	              Ordered Map	                        Unordered Map
Order           	Maintains insertion order           	    No order
