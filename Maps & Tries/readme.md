Introduction to Map

Map data structure (also known as a dictionary , associative array , or hash map ) is defined as a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a single value.

Lookup, insertion, and deletion operations in maps typically have average-case time complexities of O(1) for hash tables and O(log n) for binary search trees.
