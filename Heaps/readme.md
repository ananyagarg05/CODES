HEAPS

A Heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value. 
Heaps are usually used to implement priority queues, where the smallest (or largest) element is always at the root of the tree.

Types of Heaps

There are two main types of heaps:

Max Heap: The root node contains the maximum value, and the values decrease as you move down the tree.

Min Heap: The root node contains the minimum value, and the values increase as you move down the tree.

Heaps have various applications, like:

Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are retrieved based on their priority (maximum or minimum value).
Heapsort is a sorting algorithm that uses a heap to sort an array in ascending or descending order.
Heaps are used in graph algorithms like Dijkstra’s algorithm and Prim’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths and minimum spanning trees.
